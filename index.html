                <h3>“...one of the best vacations ever...”</h3>
                <p>
                  Peggy and I had a fantastic walking tour in Tuscany! We want
                  to give everyone in the Girosole organization who helped
                  contribute a big “molto bene” for making this one of the best
                  vacations ever. It’s obvious that Girosole had done a lot of
                  research on the route, towns, accommodation and ristorantes.
                  Everything that Girosole provided was first class. But what
                  stood out for us was the customer service. We highly recommend
                  Girosole and hope we’ll have the opportunity for returning –
                  perhaps to explore Cinque Terre next time. Thanks once again
                  for a memorable vacation.

                  A truly wonderful and memorable experience! Luca was not only
                  very knowledgeable and good company; he was always prepared to
                  go the extra mile and nothing was too much trouble for him. We
                  felt thoroughly spoilt. Thank you so much for all your efforts
                  on our behalf. It really was a pleasure dealing with Girosole.
                  Just as an aside: perhaps you should suggest that clients
                  allow for A LOT of extra baggage space for pecorini cheese,
                  paneforte, chianti classico vino, shoes and handbags!!!!!

                  Our trip was wonderful! Luca was an excellent guide, very
                  efficient, knowledgeable, and personable. I enjoyed practicing
                  my rusty Italian with him, & he taught me several proverbs &
                  expressions. When he saw I was very interested in Alpine
                  wildflowers he helped me find & identify some along the
                  trails. He was a delightful companion. The tour was very well
                  designed, in terms of our hiking ability & fitness level. We
                  started with a fairly easy hike & worked our way up to more
                  challenging. At the end we felt like we’d had a good workout,
                  but were not exhausted. The other couple in our group were
                  very close to us in terms of experience & fitness. We’d
                  recommend your tours to any active people who want to see
                  Italy off the beaten path. We enjoyed our trip immensely &
                  will remember it (& Luca) fondly. Thanks!

                <h3>“...the perfect combination...”</h3>
                <p>
                  We had a marvelous trip, and much of it was due to the
                  planning that went into the Girosole itinerary – it was the
                  perfect combination of walking, scenery, history, culture,
                  time spent with the group, and time to explore on our own. I
                  can’t imagine a better way to see the Amalfi coast. Our guide
                  Ulisse was very friendly and helpful – he did a wonderful job
                  of keeping us organized, giving us the history of the area,
                  and providing advice on things to do when we were on our own.
                  We would like to travel again with Girosole (maybe Tuscany
                  next time) and will certainly recommend the walking tours to
                  all of our friends.
