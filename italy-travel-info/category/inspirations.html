                How do Italians name their children? Generally speaking, there
                are three main categories of Italian names: Roman, religious,
                and "innovative". But perhaps even more important are the
                nicknames.

                Italian funerals: there's always one happening, they are very
                public events with an open invitation to attend, and sometimes,
                even if you didn't plan to go, you end up going – as you'll see
                from my story . . .

                Welcome to the memories and musings of Ken Cosentino, our
                resident Siciliano who hails from upstate New York – but who's
                soul is rooted in the traditions of his parents' fatherland,
                Sicily. In his occasional postings, he takes us on a tour of
                what it's like to grow up with one foot in the United States and
                the other in the Old Country.
