                Dominating the Amalfi Coast from an altitude of 350m, Ravello
                sits atop a rocky spur dividing two deep valleys. Situated thus,
                the town serves as a terrace perched high over the sea, from
                which you can enjoy a stupendous panorama of the entire
                coastline as far as Calabria in the south and Capri to the
                north. From early in its history, Ravello became a symbol of the
                ideal place to live, work, and play, with famous artists,
                writers, musicians, and the idle rich choosing it as their
                preferred haunts.
