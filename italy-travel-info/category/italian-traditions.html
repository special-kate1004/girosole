                How do Italians name their children? Generally speaking, there
                are three main categories of Italian names: Roman, religious,
                and "innovative". But perhaps even more important are the
                nicknames.

                Welcome to the memories and musings of Ken Cosentino, our
                resident Siciliano who hails from upstate New York – but who's
                soul is rooted in the traditions of his parents' fatherland,

                As an Italian-American living in New York, I've come to find
                that, though I may not be "right off the boat", I still have
                deep-rooted Italian traditions that serve as a basis for my
                everyday life. In actuality, I'm completely Sicilian and not
                Italian at all (that I know of). However, if you know your
                history, then you know that the Kingdom of Sicily is ruled by
                Italy, so I guess you could call me Italian. I don't mind it,
                though some Sicilians do.

                most interesting character in my family. This may be hard to
                believe if you've ever met his wife, aka my Nana.

                My grandfather had four brothers, of which he was the youngest.
                The brother who is the center of most family tales is not the
                oldest; but is definitely the most feared. His name was Blaze…or
                Benny for short.
