                Dominating the Amalfi Coast from an altitude of 350m, Ravello
                sits atop a rocky spur dividing two deep valleys. Situated thus,
                the town serves as a terrace perched high over the sea, from
                which you can enjoy a stupendous panorama of the entire
                coastline as far as Calabria in the south and Capri to the
                north. From early in its history, Ravello became a symbol of the
                ideal place to live, work, and play, with famous artists,
                writers, musicians, and the idle rich choosing it as their
                preferred haunts.

                Pius II in 1458, he began to realize his ambitious plans for the
                place of his birth.

                How do Italians name their children? Generally speaking, there
                are three main categories of Italian names: Roman, religious,

                As an Italian-American living in New York, I've come to find
                that, though I may not be "right off the boat", I still have
                deep-rooted Italian traditions that serve as a basis for my
                everyday life. In actuality, I'm completely Sicilian and not
                Italian at all (that I know of). However, if you know your
                history, then you know that the Kingdom of Sicily is ruled by
                Italy, so I guess you could call me Italian. I don't mind it,
                though some Sicilians do.

                My grandfather had four brothers, of which he was the youngest.
                The brother who is the center of most family tales is not the
                oldest; but is definitely the most feared. His name was Blaze…or
                Benny for short.
