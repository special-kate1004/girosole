          <h1>Booking Terms and Conditions</h1>

          <div class="guide-description">
            <p>
              By booking a GIROSOLE tour you acknowledge that you have read,
              understood and agreed to all of the following terms and
              conditions:
            </p>

            <h3>Payment schedule: Deposits</h3>
            <p>
              A deposit of USD50 per person, per trip will reserve for you the
              dates of your tour. The deposit is payable by credit card
              (VISA/Mastercard) or check. Upon receipt of your deposit, we will
              proceed to make the reservations for your tour. You should hear
              from us within 5 business days regarding the status of your
              reservations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some hotels (very few – mostly luxury hotels) request a full or
              partial payment at the time of booking. If a hotel requires us to
              make an advanced payment, we will let you know so that you can
              authorize the processing of this payment. The advanced payment
              will be deducted from the final balance due for the tour. We will
              also detail to you the hotel's cancellation policies.
            </p>

            <h3>Payment schedule: Balance</h3>
            <p>
              Full payment is due 40 days before the first day of the tour and
              is payable by credit card or personal check. If you are booking a
              tour within the 40 days, we will process the full tour price at
              the time of the tour confirmation. If you have booked an open
              tour, we may choose, at our discretion, to delay the processing of
              your final payment if we believe that other clients might book
              onto your tour and thereby change the price of your tour. Note
              that in rare cases due to difficulties with processing non-US
              credit cards, we may request non-US clients to settle via bank
              transfer.
            </p>

            <h3>If you cancel your booking</h3>
            <p>
              We have negotiated lenient cancellation policies with the hotels
              we use so that on most hotels you'll be able to cancel up to 31
              days before the departure date of your tour without a hotel
              penalty. We are also happy to book a hotel which we have not
              negotiated with. However, please keep in mind that cancellation
              policies can vary considerably between hotels outside our network.
              In any case, we will inform you of hotel policies so you can make
              the best informed decision.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you find it necessary to cancel your booking, or if your trip
              is cancelled due to force majeure, you may transfer the
              reservation to another suitable person, following acceptance by
              us. If this is not possible, then cancellation of your booking
              will become effective upon receipt by us of your written
              notification and the following charges will apply for each
              cancelling client:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>40 days or more before tour start date:</strong> you
                will receive a coupon of USD50 per person which you can use for
                your next Girosole tour. Note that in rare cases you might have
                already paid in advance for certain hotel costs (please see
                above under "Payment schedule: Deposits"). If that is the case,
                we would not be able to refund those monies, unless the hotel
                agrees to refund them.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>39 days or less before tour start date:</strong> loss of
                the USD50 per person booking deposit plus any cancellation
                penalties or costs imposed by accommodations and 3rd party
                service providers, including but not limited to guides, tour
                reps, commissions, reservations processing, credit-card fees and
                all other costs incurred as part of the process of organizing
                and reserving your tour.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>If you alter your booking</h3>
            <p>
              If you find it necessary to alter your trip in any way, we will do
              our best to accommodate your changes. This becomes more difficult,
              though, the closer we are to the trip date, so we reserve the
              right to re-price the tour to cover differences in the costs of
              your tour, hotel cancellation charges and other administrative
              costs.
            </p>

            <h3>If we alter your booking</h3>
            <p>
              Running a tour is a complex process, with many decisions made
              "behind the scenes" in order to maintain a high quality of
              service. In light of this, we reserve the right to alter our
              suggested itineraries and reservations when required by
              circumstances such as, but not confined to, closing days of
              museums and restaurants, flooded trails, strikes, disruptions of
              service by one of our service providers, changes in hotel booking
              policies, client nap schedules, sick monks, etc. etc. If such a
              change becomes necessary, we will make every effort to provide
              substitutions in kind to thereby maintain the same quality of
              itinerary originally stipulated in our materials. If we find it
              necessary for any reason other than force majeure to cancel a tour
              prior to departure, then the refund of all monies received will
              constitute a full settlement. If a client fails to make payment,
              then we reserve the right to cancel that booking without any
              obligation to refund or make alternative arrangements. We also
              reserve the right to decline to retain any client on a trip whose
              conduct or state of health is detrimental to the enjoyment of the
              other clients or disruptive of the guides' ability to provide
              service, and we shall be under no liability to reimburse the
              disruptive client for any costs incurred by such a client or by
              other clients as a result of our action.
            </p>

            <h3>Tour prices</h3>
            <p>
              Tour prices are per person in USD, based on two persons sharing a
              room. If you request a single room, a single supplement is usually
              added to the regular tour prices.
            </p>

            <h3>Tour re-pricing</h3>
            <p>
              We reserve the right to raise or lower the prices of our tours at
              any time should the euro/dollar exchange rate undergo extreme
              fluctuations. Please note that in over two decades of providing
              tours in Italy we have never implemented this kind of mid-season
              price change.
            </p>

            <h3>Re-pricing during the tour reservation process</h3>
            <p>
              We quote our tours based on the various price levels of hotels
              (comfort, select, first-class, etc.). Once your tour deposit is
              received, we start the tour reservation process, including booking
              your hotels at the level you chose. In some cases due to lack of
              availability of a hotel at the level you chose, we might have to
              reserve one or more hotels at a different price level. This may
              cause the final price of your tour to vary from that indicated in
              our tour itineraries and on our website.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, when we send the reservations confirmation email to you,
              we always disclose the names of the hotels we book and, if
              applicable, we would at this time quote a new tour price. In the
              event that you do not agree with the new proposal and price, we
              fully refund your deposit.
            </p>

            <h3>Time required to confirm a tour</h3>
            <p>
              We try our best to confirm our tours within 3 to 5 business days
              once the tour deposit is received. However, in some cases the
              process might take longer. For example the summer mountain refugi
              are closed during the winter months and during this time period
              their communication process can be slower. Also, towards the end
              of the year, some smaller hotels delay opening their reservation
              system for the following year in order to get a better estimate of
              how they should update their room prices. This can delay our
              ability to make reservations at those hotels.
            </p>

            <h3>Refunds</h3>
            <p>
              All refunds, including those for cancellations and for reductions
              of the price of your tour, will be by check or direct
              reimbursement to the credit card through which payment was
              received. Refunds will be in USD and will not reflect changes in
              the exchange rate of your local currency during the time period
              between your payment to us and our refund to you. We cannot give
              partial refunds for unused hotel rooms, meals, or any other goods
              included in the price of the trip. Trip prices are quoted as a
              package; credits are not given for services not used during a
              trip. If you wish to book only a portion of a tour, we'll be glad
              to price the tour accordingly.
            </p>

            <h3>A few words about your guide</h3>
            <p>
              On fully guided trips, your guide will be available for a minimum
              of 8 hours each day. You are welcome to schedule the day as you
              prefer, though we ask that guides be free after 8 PM, unless they
              are accompanying your party to dinner. If you like, they may
              accompany you to meals, though neither you nor they are under any
              obligation in this regard. Please feel free to make your
              preferences clear, and don't be afraid feelings might be hurt
              (they won't). Also, our guides usually do not stay at the same
              accommodations as you, unless you specifically request this. We do
              this in order to be able to maintain competitive pricing for our
              very small group tours. Since the accommodations we use can be
              expensive, we feel it is better to have our guides stay in nearby,
              less expensive accommodations or at home in order to pass this
              savings along to you. If you prefer otherwise, please let us know,
              and we will accommodate your request and re-price your tour
              accordingly.
            </p>

            <h3>Tourist City Tax</h3>
            <p>
              When staying overnight in Italy, certain cities (not all) have a
              tourist tax (also called Overnight Tax). The tax is generally
              around 1-3 euros per person per night. Because the hotels are
              required to collect the tax in cash from their clients upon
              departure, please take note of this extra cost which is not
              covered within your tour price.
            </p>

            <h3>Transportation</h3>
            <p>
              For most of our tours, we include an initial pick up and final
              drop off of clients and luggage, as well as transfers of clients
              and/or luggage during the tour. Usually, pick up and drop off will
              be in a major city or rail hub near the tour area, though we are
              glad to consider requests to pick up/drop off your party at points
              more convenient to you. All tour vehicles will be driven only by
              our authorized guides and drivers.
            </p>

            <h3>Self-Guided Tours</h3>
            <p>
              Self-guided tours are by definition private to your own group.
              However, other groups may book the same self-guided tour on the
              same dates as you, in which case we reserve the right to move all
              the groups' luggage together at the same time so that each group
              finds its luggage awaiting it at the end of the walk. Obviously,
              this in no way constrains you to participate in the walk together
              as one group. You are always freely independent of the other
              groups during your trip.
            </p>

            <h3>Actual vs GPS Miles</h3>
            <p>
              The GPS miles we list in our materials are from the trail
              start-point to the trail end-point. You can typically expect to
              walk further to get to and from those points from your hotel, as
              well as to explore around the towns and villages during the tour.
              This is particularly true for the Capri day which is listed as
              being 4.43 miles long; however, that distance only takes into
              account starting and ending at the Ignazio Cerio Museum in Capri.
              The day involves further mileage if you take into account the
              exploration of Capri, the distances for which can vary based on
              what you choose to visit.
            </p>

            <h3>Breakfasts in Italy</h3>
            <p>
              It should be understood that breakfasts in Europe are usually not
              "American style" (i.e. pancakes, waffles, omelettes, ham and eggs,
              etc.). This is more often true of our Comfort level
              accommodations, some of which may include a light breakfast in a
              nearby cafe, rather than within the establishment itself. For
              Select accommodations and higher, we use wherever possible
              accommodations that offer buffet-style breakfasts. In any case,
              rest assured that the old joke about an Italian breakfast
              consisting of an espresso and a cigarette is an exaggeration (for
              most Italians, at least).
            </p>

            <h3>Medical conditions</h3>
            <p>
              Please note that clients with medical or physical problems (bad
              knees, etc.) that could in any way impact upon their participation
              in the tour or impact upon others' participation must make these
              conditions known to us before departure. This is especially
              important if you are joining an open group tour. By notifying us,
              we will be able to plan the daily activities accordingly. Failure
              to notify us could result in your exclusion from full
              participation in tour activities based on your guide's discretion.
            </p>

            <h3>Media</h3>
            <p>
              GIROSOLE reserves the right to take photographs or videos during
              tours and of clients and to use these in our promotional materials
              without compensation or advanced notice. For our testimonials
              page, we either request a photo from the participants themselves,
              or else request permission for the use of one of our photos. If
              you find you don't like a particular use of a photograph of you in
              our materials, please notify us. In the case of electronic media
              (e.g. our website), we will remove it immediately. In the case of
              printed material, we will not include it in future printings.
              Please note that we do not currently use printed materials.
            </p>

            <h3>Trip information supplements</h3>
            <p>
              After booking you will receive an invoice, insurance information,
              a copy of these Terms and Conditions, and a standard
              <a href="/booking-release.html"
                >Acknowledgment of Risk and Release</a
              >. After full payment of your tour, you will receive a full daily
              itinerary with hotel and guide contact information, rendezvous
              instructions, packing suggestions, reading suggestions, and
              helpful details about traveling in Italy.

              <h3>"...the perfect combination..."</h3>
              <p>
                We had a marvelous trip, and much of it was due to the planning
                that went into the Girosole itinerary – it was the perfect
                combination of walking, scenery, history, culture, time spent
                with the group, and time to explore on our own. I can’t imagine
                a better way to see the Amalfi coast. Our guide Ulisse was very
                friendly and helpful – he did a wonderful job of keeping us
                organized, giving us the history of the area, and providing
                advice on things to do when we were on our own. We would like to
                travel again with Girosole (maybe Tuscany next time) and will
                certainly recommend the walking tours to all of our friends.
