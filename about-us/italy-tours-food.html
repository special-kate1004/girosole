          <h1>Fantabulous Food</h1>
          <h2>(farm fresh, healthy & out of this world)</h2>

          <div class="guide-description">
            <p>
              For our tours, we select the best of the local trattorie serving
              authentic regional specialties. These aren’t “Frommer’s Best
              Picks” but the kinds of places where Italians themselves choose to
              eat, and Italians are picky eaters: the food served had better be
              as good as what nonna dishes up at home, no frills please (and no
              menus translated into umpteen different languages either).
            </p>
            <p>
              Generally speaking, you choose freely from the menu: antipasto,
              primo, secondo, contorno, dolce, cafÃ©. Often the waiter arrives
              at the table with the menu of the day memorized and reels off a
              list (a guide comes in handy at these moments); you may see
              in-depth discussions going on at the tables around you between the
              waiter and his customers as to what exactly is in the ragu al
              contandino or what precisely constitutes un vero vincisgrassi.
            </p>

            <p>
              Every region is different, with each its own specialties; a list
              of the possible dishes you might encounter would be long indeed.
              In the countryside, you’re likely to enjoy scrumptious truffles,
              hand-made tagliatelle, and delectable wild boar, while close to
              the sea, you might try risotto al pescatore or the perennial
              Italian favorite, ‘na bella grigliata.
            </p>
            <p>
              No doubt you’ll be pleased with the generosity of the portions
              too, because the Italians like to eat well!
            </p>

              <h3>“...fabulous food and entertainment...”</h3>
              <p>
                We have returned to Iowa and settled reluctantly back into daily
                life, but we find ourselves wistfully dreaming of our days in
                southern Italy! We didn’t really know what to expect when we
                took a leap of faith and booked with Girosole tours after
                studying many options on the Internet. Believe me, the
                experience we enjoyed was above and beyond any fuzzy
                expectations we had, and we could not be more enthusiastic about
                our adventure! We had a group of 4, all 60somethings, and a main
                concern was whether we would be able to handle the physical
                demands of the hikes. Both Ulisse and Luigi were very in tuned
                to our fitness levels, and at the end of the day, we were amazed
                and proud of what we accomplished, and we could still climb the
                stairs of Positano to enjoy dinner! The annoying details of
                travel were all handled quietly and efficiently by Girosole.
                Local drivers were personable and fun, as well as skilled on the
                Italian roads! Luggage was moved from place to place and showed
                up magically in the trunk of the car! Transfers at the end of
                our tour were all arranged for us so we did not have to figure
                it out. The meals included within the tour were spectacular. Our
                first genuine Napoli pizza (we must have consumed dozens during
                our 2 weeks in Italia!), the Food Feast during our Path of the
                Gods hike (never to be forgotten…ever!) and the amazing final
                night at Ristorante Mediterraneo with fabulous food and
                entertainment…that was a highlight for sure! Without a doubt,
                our two Girosole guides were the key to our enjoyment of the
                whole experience. Having Ulisse, a Napoli native, share his city
                with us, and Luigi, a Capri native, guide us around his island,
                made the experience very meaningful and interesting. Both men
                are extremely knowledgeable, professional, and fun to be with!
                Each day of hiking was a new adventure full of challenges and
                natural beauty beyond description. It didn’t hurt that we had
                perfect weather also! Your suggestion of Ischia was just perfect
                as a destination for our final 5 days in Italy. We located a
                very cozy property minutes from the harbor in Forio, where we
                relaxed and enjoyed a slower pace, beautiful sunsets and a lot
                of wine, limoncello and gelato! So… THANK YOU to Girosole for
                orchestrating an adventure that introduced us to Napoli,
                Pompeii, Sorrento, and the amazing beauty of the Amalfi coast as
                well as the warm and wonderful people who live there.
