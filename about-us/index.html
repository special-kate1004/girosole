          <h1>Why Girosole</h1>
          <h2>e non é giusto perché (and it's not just because)</h2>

          <div class="guide-description">
            <p>
              Life is renewal.<br />
              A daily miracle.<br />
              In essence, it’s this joy you feel.<br /><br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Our aim here at GIROSOLE is to create experiences that help foster
              those truths.<br />
              We do this by crafting extraordinary holidays, what might
              generically be called “walking tours in Italy”.<br />
              Except they’re much more than that.<br />
              Browse around through the links and you’ll see why…
            </p>
            <h3>But first a little story…</h3>
            <p>You’ve arrived at the last hill of the day.</p>
            <p>
              It’s been a good, long walk. On the hot side toward noon, but you
              spent a couple of hours beneath the shade of an oak with a vista
              that was beyond the power of mere pixels to depict. Undulating
              hills gathering light, dotted with rolls of hay. Across the
              valley, a distant village, its church a single spire drilling the
              sky. A picnic lunch — none other ever tasted so good. And all
              around the droning shrill of cicadas and the dry smells of summer.
            </p>
            <p>
              And now you’re on the outskirts of that village you saw from
              across the valley. You’re soon entering within its protective
              walls through an archway used by scores of generations before you.
              A quick shower and you’re ready to explore the village’s medieval
              byways, after which a dinner in a trattoria serving local
              specialities.
            </p>
            <p>
              If that sounds to you like all the makings of a glorious day, then
              check out what our team here at GIROSOLE brings into the mix to
              ensure you have all the support you need for a fun-tastic,
              hassle-free adventure in the bel paese (“beautiful country”) of
              Italy.
            </p>
            <h3>The Really Big Difference</h3>
            <p>
              While exploring what we have on offer, keep in mind that every
              departure we run has been scheduled and planned specially by a
              client (not pre-scheduled by us). Book a tour with us and you tell
              us exactly
            </p>
            <p>
              With a personalized tour, you’re in charge, so you’re guaranteed a
              great time — with no worries about getting a “Dear Jane” letter
              from your tour operator saying they had to cancel your departure
              due to “limited participation”. Plus you get our expert assistance
              to help you make your vacation the best ever and exactly how you
              want it.
            </p>
            <p>
              We welcome all sizes of groups, from singles on up. You can book a
              trip that’s private to your own group or open it to others to join
              (in which case the maximum number of participants will be eight
              total). You’ll find that our tiered-pricing based on group size
              offers excellent value compared to other companies that only run
              fixed departures (“small groups” that often start at twelve
              participants minimum).
            </p>
            <p>
              So browse our
              <a href="/find-a-trip.html"
                >comprehensive selection of itineraries</a
              >, then <a href="/contact-us.html">contact us</a>, tell us what
              you’d like to do and we’ll help you create a wonderfully memorable
              walking holiday in Italy!

              <h3>"...the most wonderful vacation EVER!!"</h3>
              <p>
                Greg and I wanted to thank you for helping us put together the
                most wonderful vacation EVER!! Everything you told us about the
                trip was exactly as you said and even better. Our guide, Ulisse
                was perfect and he saw to our every need. For the longest time,
                we have wanted to visit the Amalfi Coast. Ulisse allowed us to
                experience it as locals and not feel like tourists. He took us
                to “out of the way” family-run restaurants where we enjoyed the
                most delicious cuisine. He knew all about the history, mythology
                and folklore of the region and entertained us non stop with his
                stories. Best of all, we never had to worry about
                transportation, entrance fees, departure times…he just told us
                what time to be ready, what to bring, how to dress and then
                everything was taken care of. One day, the weather was a bit off
                and the boats were not running to the area where we wanted to go
                so Ulisse arranged for us to grab a bus and off we went! We did
                not miss a beat and got to see all the sights as promised. A
                huge bonus was the flexibility of Girosole. Being able to select
                the dates that worked for us along with being able to arrange a
                private tour was terrific. In addition, there were a few places
                that were not included in the trip, but that I wanted to see.
                Ulisse arranged for us to make a shift in the itinerary and was
                able to accommodate us. I will definitely recommend your company
                to all my friends and will take another tour with you hopefully
                in the near future. Thank you again for a memorable experience!
