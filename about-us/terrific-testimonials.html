            <p>
              Below is just a small sampling of the hundreds of glowing
              testimonials we've received from our clients over the years.
            </p>

              />
              <p>
                Pat and I just wanted to thank you and the group at Girosole for
                making our trip to Italy this year one of our more memorable
                ones.
              </p>

              <p>
                We booked two tours with Girosole with a week in between each to
                give us time to breathe. During that week, we did the "tourist
                things", Rome and Venice.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our trip to Cinque Terre will be one that we will treasure
                always. Michangelo was an absolute charm with his humor and his
                knowledge of plants and trees. He had us hopping, hiking and
                laughing for the days we were with him. He deserves a special
                award for his choice of restaurants and wines. He was a
                treasure.
              </p>

              <p>
                The second leg of our Girosole tour was a 7 day hike through the
                Dolomites. Having ventured through Cinque Terre helped prepare
                our muscles for the hiking in the Dolomites. Stefano was a
                charm. He was a tremendous source of information regarding the
                Dolomites and the environment in general. He was a great guide
                and a lot of fun with his wry sense of humor. The staff at the
                rifugio holds a special place in our hearts. The entire family
                was warm, and charming and worked endlessly to keep you happy
                and laughing. Keep your Dolomite tours booked in their rifugio.
              </p>

              <p>Hoping to book again (possibly the Amalfi Coast).</p>

              <p>
                We found Michelangelo enthusiastic, energetic, very attuned and
                accommodating to our group and most of all, great fun!! He chose
                hikes according to our abilities, sometimes with complaints from
                us as to how hard the uphill was (always in good humor,
                however), gave interesting information along the way about the
                area and made the most of the days we were together.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our food experiences were special as he took us to good
                restaurants and encouraged us to try different foods. We must
                also give him an "A+" for patience as sometimes we were having
                so much fun we didn't want to listen. But, once again, his
                special sense of humor came through.
              </p>

              <p>
                We consider ourselves very lucky to have experienced our tour
                with such a wonderful fellow. If you ever need a recommendation,
                we are the ones to ask.

                had a fantastic time and I am going to write a more detailed
                email when I can with my great experiences, maybe a picture or

                Peter and Luciano, as promised, I am following up my message
                from last week. I will do my best to keep it organized and hope
                it is not too much detail for you (I am sure I could even write
                more!) . I have included a few pictures (Luciano – sun did
                finally come out fully in the last few days! – well, partially
                on top of Capri. Saw Capri – but as we walked rest of the way to
                top – the other side was in the clouds. As I told Ulisse, I
                always wanted to walk in the clouds…)

                Denny and I just wanted to thank you for our amazing walking
                tour of Tuscany. Truly you made the walking tour an experience
                even beyond our ambitous imaginations, but you also made the
                whole trip to Italy possible. The independent walking trip was
                absolutely perfect for us– we were free to explore the
                countryside without worrying about luggage, reservations, food
                or getting around. The route directions were extremely easy to
                follow and we really enjoyed getting to know the area firsthand
                by walking through it at our own pace. The walk was inspiring,
                amazing and 100% relaxing since Girosole took care of every
                little detail. Truly it was a honeymoon to beat all honeymoons!

                Just a quick note to say thank you for a wonderful trip, we
                enjoyed it immensely. It was really nice to get to know you and
                your associates along the way too. Maggie and I really enjoyed
                Positano and the surrounding area in addition to the wine
                hunting through Peidmont. In the future we will definitely focus
                more on the Amalfi Coast and the wine regions to the north. We
                had a great time with David and Marco the driver. I am still
                sorting through pictures in between digging out from the piles
                on my desk. We managed to snap off almost 750 pictures from
                arrival to departure. I have pulled one of the panoramic shots
                from Ravello together and attached it for you. I will forward
                some others as I get to them. Feel free to utilize them on your
                website if you'd like, I would be honored.

                You guys do such a good job of reconnoitering hotels,
                restaurants, archaeological sites and walks. I enjoyed the trip
                with you so much that I've surely sold a number of my friends on
                going with you. [My husband] Art was so jealous of my experience
                — predictably — and so we'll just have to go with you on another
                trip! Looking forward to seeing you again soon!

              <p>
                We would like to thank Girosole for an incredible time in Italy.
                Not knowing exactly how to see Italy and wanting to stay off the
                heavy tourist track, my husband and I joined an open,
                self-guided walking tour of the Hillside Towns of Tuscany.
                Little did we know we were going to join some incredibly fun
                hikers on our journey that made the trip even more delightful.
                Even though we could have chosen to walk the trails on our own,
                sharing the walks and enjoying dinner together really added to
                the wonderful experience.
              </p>

              <p>
                The hiking trails were scenic, safe, and offered many glimpses
                of the Italian lifestyle. We felt relieved to just take a small
                knapsack with us on our daily adventures while our friends from
                Girosole took care of our luggage. The friendly inn-keepers,
                restaurant hosts and drivers made the trip incredibly
                personable. I compared each day to a treasure map with lovely
                accommodations and incredible food as the reward at the end of
                the day. My husband said he never saw me eat so much, I guess
                that means I've never had such good food and wine.

                Thank you for our wonderful week in Tuscany! The excellent

                My husband and I took Girosole's Walking in Sicily tour. We
                initially chose the company based on the prompt, warm response
                received from Luciano Nonino, and based on the flexibility
                offered by the company. This was one of the few companies that
                did not have fixed start dates; rather, we could start the tour
                when it worked best for us. It requires a leap of faith to deal
                with a company entirely over the internet; Luciano put us at
                ease; he was easy to reach and very reliable.
              </p>

              <p>
                Upon arrival in Catania, we were met by our guide, Fabio, a
                native of Eastern Sicily. The tour itself was a perfect balance
                of (mostly) hiking through natural areas and some archaelogical/
                architectural sightseeing. The tour was complemented by having
                local guides give us historical tours in Taormina and Syracusa.
                Fabio managed to take the brief itinerary we had received, and
                then personalise it based on what we enjoyed, and on his
                extensive knowledge of the well known and out of the way spots…

                It was such a great tour . . . more like an outing with friends
                than a commercial operation. We have been fortunate enough to
                have done many unique things in our life. This trip is
                undoubtedly a highlight. We hope we can travel again with you
                soon.

              <p>
                I think you put together an amazing tour. We had a great time.
                We had some wonderful walks and saw some great sights. Roberto
                was a real key! He allowed us to do and see some things that
                were really special such as the acquaduct. You guys as our tour
                guides are such a big reason that this tour was so great.
                Because of that we would like to do another tour with you at
                some date.

                Judy and I really enjoyed our visit to the Marche. We were
                particularly impressed with the beauty of the countryside, and
                the variety of sights and experiences we had during our trek.
              </p>

              <p>
                We will certainly recommend your tours to our friends and
                acquaintances, and perhaps we will try one of your group tours
                some day, although we really liked the feeling of being "on our
                own" in a new and wonderful place.

                We hope you enjoy the photos. You live there, so many of these
                images will be familiar. But hopefully you'll see some fresh
                views or angles on what it was like for us to experience the
                Marche.

                Keith and I feel this trip will be hard to ever top. We hope to
                join other friends on their trip(s) to Italy. I feel lucky that
                we found your company. Walks were great! Getting to talk with
                farmer and shepherd and guy mushroom hunting was quite
                unexpected and would be hard to duplicate. Can't say enough good
                about [guide] Roberto, but he was exactly the person I would
                want on a tour because of my interest in the built environment
                and history. Food was wonderful! Hotels were nice. We can't say
                enough good — wonderful trip and enjoyable travelers. Hope to
                see you again with the rest of our mates!

                We had a lot of fun and want to thank you for the time and
                effort you put in to selecting the walks, the churches and
                castles to see and most of all for exposing us to the marvellous
                food and culture of the Tuscans. We were privileged to witness
                the people in their own environment and would like to be back
                there tomorrow.

                Just wanted to say thank you for an EXCELLENT vacation. Both of
                us felt that we got exceptional value on the tour, the walks
                were incredible, the food outstanding, the wine excellent and
                the service provided by your staff was brilliant. Both Luca and
                Freddy were outstanding guides, gracious hosts and generous with
                their time and talents. Both of them were tremendous assets to
                your company. We saw parts of Tuscany that we would never have
                found on our own, shared some great adventures and can not speak
                highly enough of all aspects of the tour. Our thanks to you for
                your patience, help and support in organizing this.

                We certainly enjoyed ourselves and have no hesitation in

                We felt our experience with Girosole was the best travel
                experience we have ever had. Next, we felt the personal interest
                you took in our individual needs and the importance you placed
                on satisfying questions, problems, etc. was extremely helpful to
                us and well beyond what we expected.
              </p>

              <p>
                To Luca and Micelangelo, our guides, we give the highest marks.
                They were a pleasure to be with the entire trip and it was
                obvious they were prepared for any problem that might have
                occured (but didn't) along the way.

                We have settled back in our routine here in Ireland after a
                wonderful Tuscan holiday. First of all I want to thank you for
                an excellent planning job. The towns chosen, the guides in each
                place, and the hotels were perfect. Even the weather co-operated
                except for the last day in Lucca, and even then it was
                atmospheric and added ot the ambience.
              </p>

              <p>
                However, we want to send a special thank you for sending
                Federico our way – he was extremely helpful, he was courteous,
                he was efficient, and also knowledgeable. We all felt that the
                trip was enhanced by his presence.
              </p>

              <p>
                I would also like to add a special thank you for the Villa
                Arceno. It was perfect for the Anniversary and your having
                flowers in the room made it very special. Thank you very much
                for thinking of that and making the necessary arrangements. The
                evening at the hotel was lovely and the meal, as mentioned, was
                superb.
              </p>

              <p>
                As you know, we made a detour near Volterra to see Venzano, a
                garden I had read about in a magazine. It was a lovely garden
                and our visit was well worth while. Federico was quite willing
                to help me find out where it was located, and also a great help
                in contacting the owners to make sure a visit was possible.

                In summing up Peter, we had a wonderful time, enjoyed Tuscany,
                and now have a desire to explore the Umbria and Marche regions.
                We would definitely recommend and use Girosole for future
                explorations.

                Thanks a million times over ! ! Our trip to Italy was all we
                wanted and much more. Michelangelo, Francesca and Roberto could
                not have been better. All were professional, very knowledgeable,
                lots of fun and had great personalities and sense of humors. We
                enjoyed their company as much as all the information they shared
                with us. The restaurants chosen were perfect and all the
                accommodations were clean, comfortable and truly Italian.

                Please convey to Peter how very highly we think of his employees
                and the tour adventures. They even made the rain fun and were
                always cognizent of our needs and safety.

                We wanted to let you know that the four and a half days we spent
                in Tuscany with Luca Granucci were without question the high
                point of our two weeks in Italy. Luca took us for wonderful
                hikes (willingly making adjustments to our fitness level), and
                showed us parts of Chianti we never could have discovered on our
                own. He arranged tastings of wine, olive oil, and cheeses,
                showed us some of the beautiful art and architecture of the
                area, and provided cheerful and supportive company every minute
                that he was with us. We could not have asked for a better guide,
                and we will enthusiastically recommend Luca and Girosole to our
                friends visiting Italy. We thank you for a fantastic Tuscany
                experience.
