            <h3>Travel Wisdom and TLC</h3>
            <p>
              Booking a GIROSOLE tour doesn’t end with a “Pay Now” click. We’re
              here to help you with your travel plans and arrangements for your
              entire stay in Italy. We can give solid advice on your before and
              after tour hotels and, if you like, make those bookings for you at
              no extra charge. Prefer to avoid crowded trains and lugging your
              luggage around in public spaces? We can book private drivers for
              your group for every stage of your Italy stay, from when you step
              out of customs upon arrival to getting you to your departure for
              home on time and without worries. We’re happy to advise you on
              your entire Italy itinerary and lend you our expertise to help you
              find interesting sites to explore, shops to visit and restaurants
              to eat at wherever you might be going.
            </p>
            <h3>In-Country Assistance</h3>
            <p>
              Help for whatever you might need is as close as a phone call to
              our central Italy office, available 24/7. Whether that’s to
              request assistance navigating the airport’s lost luggage
              bureaucracy, rescheduling hotels or train tickets, or finding a
              doctor for a medical issue, a trained staff member, fluent in
              English, is always ready to help out.
            </p>
            <h3>During Your Tour</h3>
            <p>
              Every guided tour is accompanied by a professional, licensed
              guide, fully fluent in English and local to the area they guide in
              (i.e. no recent trainees enjoying a gap year abroad on your dime
              or “owner-led” tours led by presumptuous stranieri). Your guide is
              there to help you have your best travel experience ever by
              introducing you to their home region’s true culture with its
              particular charms and flavors. They’re also alert to smooth over
              any difficulties that might happen before they happen. During
              self-guided tours, you’ll meet with your tour rep who serves much
              the same function, while also ensuring your luggage is always
              there upon arrival at each new hotel. And your tour rep is always
              just a phone call away in case you think you might be lost.
              They’ll either help talk you back onto the trail or else, if
              you’re truly lost, come and find you — a responsibility other
              companies find it convenient to wriggle out of.
            </p>
            <h3>Our Fleet</h3>
            <p>
              We work with the finest drivers in Italy to provide you with
              comfortable, professional rides both during your tour and
              before/after it. Our spacious vehicles, the best in their class,
              are stocked with amenites like free bottled water, umbrellas,
              walking sticks and samplings of local specialties. And the drivers
              are outstanding: accomplished, friendly, English-speaking and
              willing to help you discover that perfect laboratorio
              artiginale(artisan workshop) or salumeria (specialized deli).
            </p>
            <h3>GPS</h3>
            <p>
              For our self-guided tours in Tuscany and on the Amalfi Coast, we
              outfit you with GPS-enabled smart phones — along with trail
              description, maps and guides to the areas you’ll explore. We’re
              expanding to our other walking areas in 2017, as well planning
              enhancements that will make your experience even better.

              <h3>“...smooth and well organized...”</h3>
              <p>
                Thank you so much for the arrangements and accommodations that
                we enjoyed this past week. Everything was wonderful, the
                transfers were smooth and well organized and we especially
                enjoyed meeting and being with Giuseppe–he is a great guide,
                very knowing of the places we visited, and a lot of fun to be
                with. The hotel accommodations were just as we had requested,
                and the restaurants that Giuseppe took us to and recommended
                were excellent. We also enjoyed the companionship of Fabio, our
                driver for most of the transfers and trips–he has an outgoing
                personality and was great fun, and made the driving around that
                we did really special. I imagine that it was an extra cost to
                you to have Fabio as often as we seemed to need him, and we are
                grateful to you for arranging for Fabio and his vehicle. Thanks
                again to you and your staff for a wonderful family vacation.
