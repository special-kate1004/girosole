          <h1>Genuinely Great Guides</h1>
          <h2>(fun, knowledgeable, professional & 100% home grown)</h2>

          <div class="guide-description">
            <p>
              Our guides are all residents of Italy and consequently have an
              insider's knowledge of the areas they guide in. They are also
              fully licensed by local authorities as
              <em>guide ambientale</em> ("outdoors guides"). In other words, you
              won't be met with a recent trainee enjoying a gap year abroad on
              your dime, nor are you paying for an "owner-hosted" tour led by a
              presumptuous straniero who stumbles through Italian with a thick
              accent.
            </p>

            <p>
              You will find among our guides experts in Roman architecture, art
              history, environmental science, horticulture and vinting as well
              as a number of other specialties. You'll also find them fluently
              bilingual, warm, and fun-loving — pleased to help you go on a
              shopping spree or introduce you to a game of briscola (an Italian
              card game) with the locals at the central cafe.
            </p>

            <p>
              Naturally, they know the restaurants where the locals like best to
              eat, as well as the Michelin-starred eateries. And if you wake up
              in the morning wanting to walk a few more hills than the day
              before (or a few less), they can easily adjust accordingly.
            </p>

            <p>
              Flexibility and spontaneity informed by an intimate knowledge of
              the local region, supported by thorough organization and attention
              to detail: these are the hallmarks of every GIROSOLE tour (not to
              forget all the good fun involved, too!)
            </p>

              <h3>"...they were lovely..."</h3>
              <p>
                We had the most wonderful time. In great part this was due to
                the beauty of the Lakes and the Alps. However, it was also due
                to the guides that we had. So much of the experience had to do
                with those two men. In very different ways they were lovely.
                Riccardo was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the area
                and the hikes. He had to adjust our return plans a little and
                Giorgio was very helpful there and worried about us like a
                mother hen. Very sweet, actually.

                In summary, it was a delightful trip. It is a beautiful country.
                Thank you.
