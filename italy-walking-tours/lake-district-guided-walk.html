            <p>
              The National Park of the Gran Paradiso is exactly what its name
              implies – at least for hikers. Here you feel as if the heavens are
              truly within reach. Much of the pristine beauty in evidence
              everywhere you look is due to the courage and sacrifice of the
              mountain folk who have striven to preserve an uncontaminated
              territory to offer all mountain lovers. This spectacular hike
              includes a stay in Cogne, famous in Europe for its ski runs and in
              particular for the hospitality of the local people, old
              traditions, fine cuisine, amazing mountain trails – not to mention
              the deliciously strong local rendition of that spirit to beat all
              spirits: grappa!

                Our tour in Gran Paradiso was wonderful. Giuseppe worked hard to
                make our experience outstanding while helping us to stay within
                our comfort zone. Yet he provided us with the best opportunities
                to see the beauty of Gran Paradiso, even when we had to work a
                little harder (it was worth it!) He drew our attention to the
                quiet wildlife. He also explained some of the history of the
                region. During one hike, he took us on a side trail to a rifugio
                (not in use) and we saw 18 ibex of various ages. We felt
                confident that Girosole would take good care of us, and it was
                even better than we anticipated. We would definitely recommend
                Girosole to others.

          <p class="itinerary-intro">
            Here is an outline of a suggested daily itinerary. You can shorten
            or lengthen this tour to fit your travel dates. For further
            information, please request a detailed itinerary.
          </p>

          <ul class="daily-itinerary">
            <li>
              Day one: Your guide meets you in Aosta, capital of Valle d'Aosta
              and brings you to Degioz, situated in the heart of the National
              Park where you stay for the next three nights. After lunch, you
              enjoy a warm up hike in the local forests.
            </li>
            <li>
              Day two: Today features a 6-7 hour hike with a 1000 meter total
              climb to the crystalline glacial lakes of Lago Djouan (2516m) and
              Lago Nero (2666m).
            </li>
            <li>
              Day three: After a short transfer to the fairy-tale wooden village
              of Nex Tignet (1664m), you follow an enchanting trail leading you
              to the high valley of Levionaz, an excellent setting in which to
              observe the park's abundant wildlife.
            </li>
            <li>
              Day four: You start with a transfer to the other side of the park
              – to Cogne where you will stay the next three nights. After lunch,
              there is time to explore Cogne and enjoy a hike into the
              surrounding area.
            </li>
            <li>
              Day five: Today's hike, the most challenging of the tour, starts
              from the small village of Valnontey (1666m) and brings you to the
              Rifugio Sella (2656m), halfway through the hike, surrounded by
              glaciers and dramatic high peaks.
            </li>
            <li>
              Day six: Another spectacular hike brings you from the village of
              Sylvenoire (1324m) to the impressive north side of the Grivola
              (considered by alpinists one of the most beautiful mountain of the
              Italian alps), and the high valley of Gran Nomenon.
            </li>
            <li>
              Day seven: In the morning, your guide helps you on your way to
              your next destination with a transfer back to Aosta.

              <p>
                Thank you so much for the arrangements and accommodations that
                we enjoyed this past week. Everything was wonderful, the
                transfers were smooth and well organized and we especially
                enjoyed meeting and being with Giuseppe–he is a great guide,
                very knowing of the places we visited, and a lot of fun to be
                with. The hotel accommodations were just as we had requested,
                and the restaurants that Giuseppe took us to and recommended
                were excellent. We also enjoyed the companionship of Fabio, our
                driver for most of the transfers and trips–he has an outgoing
                personality and was great fun, and made the driving around that
                we did really special. I imagine that it was an extra cost to
                you to have Fabio as often as we seemed to need him, and we are
                grateful to you for arranging for Fabio and his vehicle. Thanks
                again to you and your staff for a wonderful family vacation.

              <h3>“...fabulous food and entertainment...”</h3>
              <p>
                We have returned to Iowa and settled reluctantly back into daily
                life, but we find ourselves wistfully dreaming of our days in
                southern Italy! We didn’t really know what to expect when we
                took a leap of faith and booked with Girosole tours after
                studying many options on the Internet. Believe me, the
                experience we enjoyed was above and beyond any fuzzy
                expectations we had, and we could not be more enthusiastic about
                our adventure! We had a group of 4, all 60somethings, and a main
                concern was whether we would be able to handle the physical
                demands of the hikes. Both Ulisse and Luigi were very in tuned
                to our fitness levels, and at the end of the day, we were amazed
                and proud of what we accomplished, and we could still climb the
                stairs of Positano to enjoy dinner! The annoying details of
                travel were all handled quietly and efficiently by Girosole.
                Local drivers were personable and fun, as well as skilled on the
                Italian roads! Luggage was moved from place to place and showed
                up magically in the trunk of the car! Transfers at the end of
                our tour were all arranged for us so we did not have to figure
                it out. The meals included within the tour were spectacular. Our
                first genuine Napoli pizza (we must have consumed dozens during
                our 2 weeks in Italia!), the Food Feast during our Path of the
                Gods hike (never to be forgotten…ever!) and the amazing final
                night at Ristorante Mediterraneo with fabulous food and
                entertainment…that was a highlight for sure! Without a doubt,
                our two Girosole guides were the key to our enjoyment of the
                whole experience. Having Ulisse, a Napoli native, share his city
                with us, and Luigi, a Capri native, guide us around his island,
                made the experience very meaningful and interesting. Both men
                are extremely knowledgeable, professional, and fun to be with!
                Each day of hiking was a new adventure full of challenges and
                natural beauty beyond description. It didn’t hurt that we had
                perfect weather also! Your suggestion of Ischia was just perfect
                as a destination for our final 5 days in Italy. We located a
                very cozy property minutes from the harbor in Forio, where we
                relaxed and enjoyed a slower pace, beautiful sunsets and a lot
                of wine, limoncello and gelato! So… THANK YOU to Girosole for
                orchestrating an adventure that introduced us to Napoli,
                Pompeii, Sorrento, and the amazing beauty of the Amalfi coast as
                well as the warm and wonderful people who live there.

                Keith and I feel this trip will be hard to ever top. Getting to
                talk with farmer and shepherd and guy mushroom hunting was quite
                unexpected and would be hard to duplicate. Can’t say enough good
                about [guide] Roberto, but he was exactly the person I would
                want on a tour because of my interest in the built environment
                and history. I feel lucky that we found your company. Food was
                wonderful! Hotels were nice. We can’t say enough good —
                wonderful trip and enjoyable travelers. Hope to see you again

                The trip was GREAT! Loved the places we stayed, especially

                personal feel. Rocca d’Orcia had the best and friendliest
                restaurant! Montalcino had a small village feel with very unique
                handmade local items. Montepulciano had the most shopping
                opportunities, and Siena was the best start to the trip with 2
                great hosts in each of our hotels. Nice personal touches. We all
                agreed that this was the best trip any of us had ever been on,
                and we all have travel extensively. It was also the most unique
                and relaxing trip. I will definitely keep this company in mind
                for future trips and have and will continue to tell people about
                our Journey through Tuscany!

              <h3>“...they were lovely...”</h3>
              <p>
                We had the most wonderful time. In great part this was due to
                the beauty of the Lakes and the Alps. However, it was also due
                to the guides that we had. So much of the experience had to do
                with those two men. In very different ways they were lovely.
                Giorgio led us a little off of the established schedule because
                he wanted us to see his beloved mountains and the time was very
                well spent. Giuseppe was a wonderful guide, very educated and
                gentle and gave us a real sense of what hiking – serious hiking
                and mountain climbing – might be like. They both added to the
                pleasure of the trip. We changed our return plans a little and
                Giorgio was very helpful there and worried about us like a
                mother hen. Very sweet, actually.
                <br />
                In summary, it was a delightful trip. It is a beautiful country.
                Thank you.

              <h3>“I will never forget it.”</h3>
              <p>
                We had a wonderful time in Italy. Alessandro was an excellent
                guide. He was extremely knowledgeable about the area and very
                flexible. I told him it was the perfect combination of history,
                nature and culture. We really enjoyed seeing a more “authentic”
                Italy, not so crowded with other tourists. Also, as you know, I
                was very excited to go to Abruzzo because of my family’s
                history. Well, at Hotel Due Monti in Ateleta we discovered the
                manager/owner, was one of the record keepers for the town. He
                was able to give me information about my family tree and even
                was able to show me some birth and marital records of my family.
                Before leaving the town, we stopped by the Civic Center which
                was closed, but the Mayor was there. It was truly one of the
                best experiences of my life. I can speak a little Italian, but
                Alessandro was extremely generous with his time to help me speak
                with the locals about my family. I will never forget it.
                <br />This is our second time traveling with Girosole. Thank you
                for helping us with another amazing trip!

              <p>
                My husband and I absolutely loved this trip. Luca was a fabulous
                tour guide–humorous, knowledgeable and dependable. The best part
                about the trip was that we saw no other tourists while on the
                trails (only another group of hikers for the whole 5 days, and
                encountered other tourists in some of our bed & breakfasts). We
                definitely enjoyed taking in the Italian lifestyle: relaxed
                pace, wonderful food and wine, and gorgeous scenery. We thought
                the pace and distance was just right. Challenging enough, but
                not difficult to the point where it seemed impossible. The route
                took us through some very small towns, each with its own
                character and charm. We enjoyed walking through forests, hidden
                trails, and over mountains. The accommodations were all
                comfortable, clean, unique, and set in beautiful and convenient
                locations. Our favorites were in Bibicci and in Gaiole in
                Chianti. The food was wonderful. The best lunch at a restaurant
                was in Lamole, at Ristoro di Lamole. Our packed lunches included
                enough food and we did not go hungry. We loved our trip and it
                was extremely memorable. We would definitely recommend this trip
                to our friends.

                The Chianti trek with Luca was the best hike/trip I have ever
                had. Luca was excellent. He created an incredible hike and great
                scenary plus he kept us going even when we were tired and hot.
                It was challenging but we all made it and it felt great! I am
                going do another trek with Luca in the Italian Alps next year!
                He is wonderful. Thank you.

                We had a real adventure and perhaps it was a bit too
                adventurous, it was very strenuous, two of the party who have
                been to Everest base camp from the Tibet side said that this
                walk was harder. It was a wonderful experience, the mountains
                are truly spectacular, the food was great (and we really needed
                it) and the accommodation was fine, sometimes very basic and
                sometimes quite chic. We all agreed that we wouldn’t have missed
                it for anything

              <p>
                Our tour in Gran Paradiso was wonderful. Giuseppe worked hard to
                make our experience outstanding while helping us to stay within
                our comfort zone. Yet he provided us with the best opportunities
                to see the beauty of Gran Paradiso, even when we had to work a
                little harder (it was worth it!) He drew our attention to the
                quiet wildlife. He also explained some of the history of the
                region. During one hike, he took us on a side trail to a rifugio
                (not in use) and we saw 18 ibex of various ages. We felt
                confident that Girosole would take good care of us, and it was
                even better than we anticipated. We would definitely recommend
                Girosole to others.
